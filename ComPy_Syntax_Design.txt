ComPy and Crayon OS were designed by Kyle Fry under the assembly language compiled and run by C++ and
Python, thus why the language is called ComPy (Compiled Python). Compiled Python compresses the easy syntax
of Python and the speed of compilation of the C family languages to help make speedy processes. ComPy will be
classified as a compiled object oriented language, in which all programs and its arguements must be declared 
in a function to allow use and proper execution.

========== NOTICE ==========
ComPy is currently under development and its
structures are still not mature. Errors should be
expected and allowed for bug fixes and numerous
attempts at executing a program.
============================

ComPy Syntax version 1.o compiled, structured, and designed by Kyle Fry (2017)

Like the commands print() and cout, ComPy has a dedicated command for printing to console, show(). But just like
C++, or any C family language for that matter, must be placed inside a function, which ComPy calls Main().
In order for a function to be called and loaded (load()), there must be an action for which the arguements 
will be loaded to. For printing to a console window, the first line must be in the use() syntax. The 
registries of ComPy will be used for command prompt as "use(os.cmd)" which will come from the Python derivitive
import(os) and C:\Users\[More Here]. Semicolons must be used in order to finish a statement in ONE LINE. 

---->NOTE: ComPy functions are cAsE SeNsItIvE and must include Name() and {arguements}. ComPy will automatically
---->skip to the next line when doing two show() commands in a row. This can be overrided by inputing
---->"enable(comp.newl) = false;". Notes can be ignored by the compiler if a # is place at the beginning and end
---->of the comment.

Example:
  #State what program to apply the arguements to#
  use(os.cmd);
  
  #Declare the function Main() and give command to print#
  func.Main() {
    show("Hello World!");
   }
   
   #Tell compiler to execute script after compilation is completed#
   load()
   
   #This should print out: Hello World!#
