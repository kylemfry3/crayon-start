===== CRAYON OS v1.x =====
===== Kyle Fry, 2017 =====

NOTICE:

	In order to process and continue to start the CrayonOS installation process, you must have IDLE Python 3.6
	or the Python 3.6 Interpreter/compiler installed on your local machine. Crayon OS is in development; please
	expect bugs and do not rely fully on it because it is not mature yet. **THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR TESTING
	AND EXPERIMENTATION PURPOSES**
	
INTRODUCTION TO CRAYON OS:
	
	Thank you for deciding to participate in the creation of a new developing operating system, Crayon OS! Crayon
	OS is designed to allow any user; new or experienced in coding, file organization, and system usage alike to 
	optimize the system for the sole purpose of allowing them to better use thier computer to their everyday needs.
	Templates will be designed and developed as soon as the first stable version of Crayon OS is released. Until then,
	do not hesistate to add any patches or report any bugs to me, Kyle Fry, if there is any not mentioned or being
	worked on.
	
HOW TO INSTALL CRAYON OS SOURCE:
	
	The Crayon OS Source should have been in the same file folder that you are reading this in. If not, please re-download
	this folder from GitHub or contact me directly at kylemfry3@gmail.com if there are any conflicts with this.
	
	1. Extract and run the "compat-finder.py" file by manually moving to it via command prompt (A more convinient process
	will be worked on later)
	
	2. After running the file, you will reach an input field that will ask for you to locate where your "start-crayon.html"
	file is located. Please find where the folder you extracted ended up and move it to the directory "C:\". This should be
	the folder where you have Program Files, Users, AppData, etc. Now, in the input box, type "C:\start-crayon.html". The 
	program will find the file, which may take up to 5 seconds, then it will open a web browser window.
	
	3. In this web browser window, you will see that there are a few options: Create, Install, and Help. Please click on
	Install.
	
	4. After clicking install, you will be directed to a Google Drive address, where you will download "CrayonOS-1.x.x"
	
	5. After installing, extract and navigate to the .ISO file. Keep this file explorer tab open.
	
	6. If you have not installed already, please install either VMWare or VirtualBox on your computer (I will be using
	VMWare)
	
	7. Run VMWare and "Add a virtual machine"
	
	8. Set the OS Type to "Other" on both boxes
	
	9. Set the memory to what seems reasonable to you.
	
	10. Save the machine as whatever you'd like, make sure it's something you can remember.
	
	11. Click "Run this machine" and enjoy!
