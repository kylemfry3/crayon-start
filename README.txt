===== CRAYON OS =====
=====    v1.0   =====
compiled and designed by Kyle Fry (LAST UPDATED 10/25/17 @ 12:45)

ABOUT:

Crayon OS is designed to be written in Assembly and a combination of C and Python objective scripts. You
may use these repositiories to your needs, but do kindly remember the credit. There will be a watermark in
every script and any form of Crayon OS that will be used in the future must have a record of structure of 
use by the user with agreement from Kyle Fry.

Using the tools and scripts given in the repositories, you can create and optimize your own version of Crayon OS
as well as the basic syntax of Crayon OS's default basic language, ComPy.

Best Regards,

Kyle Fry
